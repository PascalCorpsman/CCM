# CCM
This is the public source mirror of the CCM Project.

!! Attention !!<br>
It is possible to compile the CCM-Project out of the given code, but the lab cache features will be disabled, as i am not allowed to publish the needed keys for the lab-API.

If you find a bug / missing feature, you need to go the "normal" process with a ticket and i will give my best to fix / recompile the code and then republis the binaries on [www.Corpsman.de ](https://www.Corpsman.de)
